## Description

You will participate in two mock system design interviews. One as an interviewer and the other as the interviewee. The students are randomly divided into two groups, and each group has been assigned a different software system design problem. The problems are selected to mimic the system design problems that arise during technical interviews.

>  Upon releasing this homework, a post will be made on our course Slack workspace that lists the pairs of interviewers and interviewees.

## Instructions

- **For Interviewers:**
    - You will receive a system design question (with solution) via a private post on Slack. Please keep this confidential.
    - Coordinate with your interviewee to schedule a 45-minute Zoom session. Use Slack for communication and Include your instructor in the scheduling DM. 
    - Follow the provided guidelines to conduct a professional and effective interview. Make sure to record the session to the Zoom cloud and share the link (to the recording) on the same Slack DM used to schedule the interview.
    - Evaluate the interviewee using the provided rubric and share your feedback within 48 hours of the interview. Please share this feedback on the same Slack message used to schedule the interview.
- **For Interviewees:**
    - Respond promptly to scheduling requests.
    - Prepare as you would for a real technical interview.
    - Actively engage during the interview.
    - Conduct a self-evaluation using the same rubric and share your self-assessment within 48 hours. Please share this self-assessment on the same Slack thread used to schedule the interview.

## Submission

By the deadline for this homework assignment, you must submit the files in this repository on Gradescope.


## Appendix A: Guidelines for Interviewers

### 1. Preparation

- **Familiarize with the Question:** Thoroughly study the system design problem and its solution provided to you. Understand the key concepts, functional and non-functional requirements, and the rationale behind the proposed solution.
- **Set Up Excalidraw:** Before the interview, set up a session on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), an online whiteboard tool. This tool will be used for collaborative diagramming and visualization during the interview. Prior to the interview, write down the system design problem and list all the functional and non-functional requirements on Excalidraw. This preparation will save both you and the interviewee valuable time.

### 2. Starting the Interview

- **Explain the Problem:** Begin the interview by clearly explaining the system design problem to the interviewee. Make sure to cover all functional and non-functional requirements listed in the problem statement.
- **Encourage Clarifying Questions:** Allow the interviewee to ask any clarifying questions they might have about the problem. This helps ensure they have a clear understanding before they start designing the system.

### 3. During the Interview

- **Use Excalidraw for Collaboration:** Share your Excalidraw session with the interviewee. Use this tool to collaboratively sketch out diagrams, jot down ideas, and visually communicate throughout the interview.
- **Guide the Design Process:** Prompt the interviewee to start designing the system. While they lead the design, your role is to guide, challenge, and probe their thought process. Ask questions that encourage them to think about different aspects of the system, such as scalability, performance, etc.

### 4. Maintaining Interview Quality

- **Stay Engaged:** Remain actively engaged throughout the interview. Pay attention to the interviewee's explanations and sketches, offering feedback or hints as needed.
- **Manage Time Effectively:** Keep an eye on the time. Ensure that the interviewee has enough time to cover the breadth of the design, but also keep the discussion focused and on track.

### 5. Concluding the Interview

- **Summarize Key Points:** At the end of the interview, summarize the key points discussed. Highlight the strengths of the interviewee’s design and mention areas that could be improved or explored further.
- **Encourage Self-Reflection:** Invite the interviewee to reflect on their design and the interview process. This encourages self-assessment and learning.

### 6. Post-Interview

- **Provide Constructive Feedback:** Using the evaluation rubric, provide constructive feedback to the interviewee. Mention specific strengths ('glows') and areas for improvement ('grows').

### Additional Tips:

- **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional demeanor throughout the interview. Be respectful and supportive, creating a positive environment for the interviewee.
- **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adapt the discussion based on the interviewee’s responses. The goal is to challenge their understanding and creativity, not to strictly adhere to a predefined path.

## Appendix B: Guidelines for Interviewees

### 1. Pre-Interview Preparation

- **Understand the Process:** Familiarize yourself with the format of a system design interview. Know that you will be asked to design a system based on given requirements.
- **Review Fundamentals:** Brush up on key system design concepts and principles. Ensure you have a good grasp of topics like scalability, availability, performance, and reliability.

### 2. During the Interview

- **Clarifying Questions:** When presented with the problem, take the time to ask clarifying questions. Make sure you fully understand the functional and non-functional requirements before you begin designing.
- **Use Excalidraw Effectively:** Engage with the online whiteboard (Excalidraw) shared by the interviewer. Use it to sketch your design ideas and illustrate your thought process.
- **Think Aloud:** Verbalize your thought process as you design the system. This helps the interviewer understand your approach and decision-making.
- **Stay Open to Feedback:** Be receptive to hints or guidance from the interviewer. They may provide valuable insights or challenge your assumptions, helping you refine your design.

### 3. Post-Interview

- **Reflect on Performance:** After the interview, take some time to reflect on how you did. Consider what went well and what areas you could improve in.
- **Prepare for Evaluation:** Use the feedback from the interviewer to prepare your self-evaluation. Be honest and constructive in assessing your performance.

### Additional Tips:

- **Problem-Solving Mindset:** Approach the interview as a problem-solving exercise. Focus on finding effective and efficient solutions rather than just the 'right' answer.
- **Communication:** Clearly communicate your ideas, and don't hesitate to express any uncertainties or alternative approaches you might consider.
- **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional demeanor throughout the interview. Be punctual, respectful, and engaged.

## Appendix C: Mock Interview Evaluation Rubric

Both the interviewer and interviewee need to complete the evaluation. The interviewer will evaluate the interviewee (peer evaluation), while the interviewee will evaluate themselves (self-evaluation).

To complete the evaluation, follow these steps:

1. Open the provided evaluation template (either the peer evaluation or self-evaluation).
2. Fill out the evaluation.
3. Save the document.
4. Share the content of the evaluation on the Slack thread used to schedule the interview.
5. By the deadline, submit this repository on Gradescope.

For each heading in the evaluation rubric, please consider the following scoring scheme:

- 1: Needs significant improvement.
- 2: Below expectations, some understanding shown.
- 3: Meets expectations, competent.
- 4: Exceeds expectations, shows depth and insight.

In addition to providing a score, you must leave some constructive comments. You can use the comments to elaborate on the score and/or use the Glow/Grow model. 

The Glow/Grow model is a feedback framework used to provide constructive feedback. It consists of two components: "Glow" and "Grow." Here's an explanation of each component:

- **Glow:** The "Glow" component focuses on highlighting the strengths or positive aspects of someone's performance. It acknowledges and commends the areas where the individual excelled or demonstrated strong skills or qualities. By recognizing and reinforcing these positive aspects, it encourages the person to continue building on their strengths.
- **Grow:** The "Grow" component aims to provide suggestions for improvement or areas where the individual can develop further. It identifies opportunities for growth and offers constructive feedback on specific aspects that can be enhanced or refined. The "Grow" component is meant to be supportive and guide the person towards continuous improvement.

Together, the Glow/Grow model helps create a balanced feedback approach that recognizes achievements while also providing actionable recommendations for growth and development. It encourages individuals to leverage their strengths while working on areas that need improvement, fostering personal and professional growth.

It is important to be objective in the evaluation of the mock interview. The scores you assign here will not impact your homework grade. Objectivity promotes a learning environment where interviewees can receive honest feedback and identify areas for growth. It allows interviewees to understand their strengths and weaknesses objectively, enabling them to work on specific areas of improvement. This constructive feedback is instrumental in their development as they progress through their technical interview preparation.
